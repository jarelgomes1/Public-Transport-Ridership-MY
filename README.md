1. Domain
The domain of my visualization focuses on public transport ridership trends in Malaysia. It examines the daily ridership data for various public transport services across the country, including bus services like Rapid Bus (KL, Penang, Kuantan) and major rail services such as LRT, MRT, Monorail, KTM, and ETS. This visualization will provide insights into the usage patterns of public transportation and highlight the fluctuations in ridership across different modes of transport.

2. Why?
Understanding public transport ridership trends is crucial for policymakers, transportation authorities, urban planners, and even daily commuters. It helps to identify peak usage times, assess the efficiency and popularity of different transport modes, and aid in making data-driven decisions regarding improvements in public transportation services. Additionally, this visualization can reveal how certain external factors, like holidays or economic events, impact ridership, making it valuable for resource allocation and future transportation planning.

3. Datasets
The dataset for this visualization is sourced from the Malaysian governmentâ€™s public data portal, data.gov.my, and provides daily public transport ridership for various modes of transport across Malaysia. The dataset can be accessed via the following URL:

4. Design Ideas
For the visualization, I plan to utilize several visual idioms to communicate insights clearly:
1. Line Charts to track ridership trends over time for each transport type.
2. Facet Grids to compare ridership across different transport modes.
3. Heatmaps to identify high and low ridership periods.
4. Bar Charts or Stacked Bar Charts to compare total ridership between different transport systems.


I am inspired by existing visualizations that effectively showcase time-series data and multi-category comparisons, such as ridership dashboards used by major cities like New York and London, which present clear and interactive visualizations of transport data.
